## About Me
Hi there! I am Lakshmi, a passionate and dedicated Data Analyst. With a keen eye for detail and a knack for problem-solving, I am always eager to dive into new challenges and explore innovative solutions. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics with a focus on Information Processing Science.

Having spent 6 years as a software tester, I developed a keen eye for detail and a systematic approach to problem-solving. This experience laid a strong foundation for my transition into the world of data analysis. Since then, I've honed my skills in data analysis and visualization. 

I'm driven by a desire to make a positive impact through my work. I believe that data-driven insights can revolutionize industries and improve people's lives. I'm committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in my field.

When I'm not immersed in code or data, I enjoy travelling and dancing. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
